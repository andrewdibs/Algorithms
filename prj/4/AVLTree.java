/* An AVLNode represents a node in an AVL-balanced binary search tree. Each
 * AVLNode object stores a single item (called "data"). Each object also has
 * left and right references, which point to the left and right subtrees, and it
 * knows its own height (the path length to its deepest descendant).
 *
 * The AVLTree can be seen as superclass of the AVLNode class, so that the 
 * AVLTree may make changes to the internals of an AVLNode.
 *
 * Many of the methods in this class are virtually identical to those in the
 * BSTNode in the previous project (#3), including the constructor,
 * getLeft(), getRight(), getData(), printPreorder(), verifySearchOrder(),
 * minNode(), maxNode(), and the copy constructor.
 *
 * The function verifyBalance() can be used to do verifications that the AVL
 * balance property holds at each node. It also can and should be used for
 * testing purposes. What is its running time?
 *
 * The singleRotateLeft() and singleRotateRight() methods do a single rotation
 * on the node they are called on, and return a reference to the node that takes
 * its place (so that the node's parent's reference can be changed).  Note that
 * these methods should update the heights of some nodes as necessary.
 *
 * The doubleRotateLeftRight() and doubleRotateRightLeft() methods do a double
 * rotation on the node they are called on. This is really simple if you have
 * implemented the single rotation methods; my double rotation methods are two
 * lines each. These methods return a reference to the node which took the place
 * of the node the method was called on (so that the node's parent's reference 
 * can be changed).
 *
 * The getHeight() method is a static method which takes a reference to a node,
 * and returns the height of that node (or -1 if the reference is NULL). This
 * makes it easy to find the height of any node with a reference, without having
 * to check for NULL.
 *
 * The updateHeight() method calculates and updates the value of the height on
 * the node it's called on. It assumes that the height values for the two
 * children of this node are correct, and uses them.

/* An AVLTree is a String-based class that represents an AVL-balanced binary 
 * search tree. It has one data member, "root", which is a reference to the 
 * root of the tree.
 *
 * Many of the methods in this class are virtually identical to methods in the
 * BST from the previous project (#3), including the constructor,
 * printPreorder(), verifySearchOrder(), and copy constructor.
 *
 * The insert() and remove() methods behave as in the plain BST, but both
 * methods should rebalance the tree as necessary. This is best done by creating
 * an array of references to AVLNode objects as the insert/remove methods search
 * for the place to do their work.  This array of references represents the path
 * taken to get from the root to the place where a change occurs in the tree.
 * Note that for remove(), this path might go deeper than the node removed, in
 * the case of removing a node with two children (think carefully about this).
 * After insert/remove finish updating the tree, they can pass the path to
 * rebalancePathToRoot() which actually does the rebalancing. Think about how
 * large the array of references needs to be, at its largest. An AVL tree with
 * height 30 must have at least 3,524,577 nodes, and if it has height 50, it
 * must have at least 53,316,291,172 nodes -- probably more than we care to put
 * in the tree. These results come from the minimum size of an AVL tree of
 * height h, which is described in your book as: S(h) = S(h - 1) + S(h - 2) + 1
 * (and base cases S(0) = 1, S(1) = 2).
 *
 * The printLevelOrder() method prints out all the nodes in the tree in
 * level-order (root, then the root's children, then their children, etc.). This
 * is like performing a breadth-first search of the tree. The method should put
 * up to 20 nodes on each line, and use multiple lines as necessary. This method
 * should use a Java queue, and it is iterative (not recursive). This method is
 * useful if we want to transmit the information for building exactly the same
 * tree to our correspondent. If we were to take all the non-NULL nodes and
 * insert them in the order printed by this method, we would get the exact same
 * tree. We would not always be able to construct the exact same tree if we were
 * to use printPreorder() instead.
 *
 * The rebalancePathToRoot() method takes an array of references to AVLNode
 * objects, and the number of references that are on the array. This array should
 * represent the path that needs rebalancing after an insert or remove. It's
 * probably best to have the root at the start of the array. This method should
 * walk from the bottom of the path to the root, checking for imbalances, and
 * correcting any it finds by calling rotation methods as necessary to correct
 * imbalances.
