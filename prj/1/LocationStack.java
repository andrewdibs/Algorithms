/* Class declaration for a simple stack of Location objects. It is not
 * a difficult class; it can contain only Location objects. It can
 * grow and shrink because it is a linked structure. The class
 * LocationStackNode (below) encapsulates the nodes of the stack.
 *
 * Methods push(), pop(), and getTop() provide standard stack methods.
 * Using assert() to check for problems in these three methods could
 * be useful (hint).  isEmpty() returns true if the stack is empty,
 * false otherwise. isOn() returns true if the given Location is on
 * the stack, otherwise returns false.
 *
 * streamOut() streams out the stack from bottom to top. This method
 * should NOT make a copy of the stack. Instead, it should require two
 * passes over the stack to print the stack. The first pass will
 * traverse the stack to top->bottom, reversing the links of the nodes
 * as it goes. The second pass will traverse from bottom->top,
 * printing each Location as it is visited, and undoing the reversing
 * of the node links.
 *
 * The default constructor initializes the data members as
 * appropriate. The copy constructor is not usable in this class;
 * therefore it is private and will fail on an assert() if called.
 *
 * The data member top is a reference to the top node.

 * constructors may not be called as they are not necessary. These
 * restrictions help prevent us from accidentally making multiple

 * If we set a LocationStack objet to null, this should invoke the garbage
 * collector and delete the nextNode in LocationStackNode, so that deleting
 * the top of the stack has a chaining effect that deletes every node
 * on the stack.

 * The get/set methods for this class are self-explanatory, and are
 * the interface by which you should modify a node as necessary.
